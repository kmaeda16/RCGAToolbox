function [] = IQMrunNONMEMproject(projectPath,NPROCESSORS,NO_GOF_PLOTS)
% This function runs a specified NONMEM project.
%
% [SYNTAX]
% [] = IQMrunNONMEMproject(projectPath)
% [] = IQMrunNONMEMproject(projectPath,N_PROCESSORS)
% [] = IQMrunNONMEMproject(projectPath,N_PROCESSORS,NO_GOF_PLOTS)
%
% [INPUT]
% projectPath:      Path to the project.nmctl NONMEM project file
% NPROCESSORS:      Number of processors if use of parallel (default: 1)
% NO_GOF_PLOTS:     =0: Create GoF plots for all runs (default), 
%                   =1: No Gof plots
%
% [OUTPUT]
% Output generated in the RESULTS folder of the NONMEM project.
%
% Control NONMEM run from commandline:
% ====================================
% CTRL-J: Console iteration printing on/off 
% CTRL-K: Exit analysis at any time, which completes its output, and goes
%         on to next mode or estimation method
% CTRL-E: Exit program gracefully at any time
% CTRL-T: Monitor the progress of each individual during an estimation by
%         toggling ctrl-T. Wait 15 seconds or more to observe a subjectâ€™s
%         ID, and individual objective function value. It is also good to
%         test that the problem did not hang if a console output had not
%         been observed for a long while

% Handling stupid NONMEM

%
% However, it can create the temporaryfile.xml, which is identical (at
% least in all the cases I tested. 
% 
% So to circumvent an issue, if the project.xml file is not present but the
% temporaryfile.xml file is present this one will be renamed!
%
% ICON: please get your software in order and fit for a decent way of
% working that is consistent with the year 2016 and not with 1980! Thanks!
