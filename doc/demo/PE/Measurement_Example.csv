% Example measurement data file in the format required by IQM Tools
% ======================================================================
%
% This file is based on MeasurementExample.csv from SBPOP PACKAGE.
% A line starting with the percentage character "%" is interpreted as a
% comment line and neglected during the import of the measurement data.

[Name]
% The following line defines the name of the measurement data.
% It makes sense to keep the name relatively short.
Measurement

[Notes]
Here you can enter information about the experiment and the data. 
Experimental conditions, when the measurement was performed, everything you
think will be of use to you later.

[Components]
% A comma separated list, defining the names of the measured components.
% The 'time' component should always be called 'time'!
time,X1,X2

[Componentnotes]
% For each component a note can be defined. The syntax is as follows:
X1: Metabolite 1
X2: Metabolite 2

[Values]
% Finally, here are the data defined for the components. In this example the 
% time-vector is defined in the first column (which is not required but makes 
% most sense). The time vector consists of all time instants at which 
% measurements have been made. If a certain component has not been measured 
% at a certain time instant then this can be indicated by 'NaN' or not 
% entering a value for this time step.
