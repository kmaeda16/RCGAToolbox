To start benchmark experiments, run run_Benchmark.m in the directories MATLAB_GA, eSS, and RCGA.

- For the function batch, Parallel Computing Toolbox is required.
- For the function ga, Global Optimization Toolbox is required.
- For the function ess_kernel, SSm GO Toolbox is required.
- Before starting benchmark experiments, threestep_con_mex and hiv_con_mex need to be generated by mex command. Use mex_threestep.m and mex_hiv.m with modification. We used sundials-2.4.0 for threestep_con_mex and hiv_con_mex.
