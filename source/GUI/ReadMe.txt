RCGAToolbox/source/GUI includes GUIs and associated scripts.

RCGAToolbox_MissionControl.m and RCGAToolbox_MissionControl_PE.m:
GUI initiators and version selectors.

R2016a/RCGAToolbox_MissionControl_R2016a.mlapp and RCGAToolbox_MissionControl_PE_R2016a.mlapp:
GUIs created by MATLAB R2016a (Windows). In theory, these are executable by any MATLAB versions newer than or equal to R2016a.

R2016a/RCGAcreateExecutableScript_R2016a.m and RCGAcreateExecutableScript_PE_R2016a.m:
Functions to create executable scripts.

R2021a/RCGAToolbox_MissionControl_R2021a.mlapp and RCGAToolbox_MissionControl_PE_R2021a.mlapp:
GUIs created by MATLAB R2021a (Mac). These were created by loading RCGAToolbox_MissionControl_R2016a.mlapp and RCGAToolbox_MissionControl_PE_R2016a.mlapp on MATLAB R2021a (Mac), renaming, and saving them. Please note that RCGAToolbox_MissionControl_R2021a.mlapp and RCGAToolbox_MissionControl_PE_R2021a.mlapp use R2016a/RCGAcreateExecutableScript_R2016a.m and RCGAcreateExecutableScript_PE_R2016a.m to create executable scripts. RCGAToolbox_MissionControl_R2021a.mlapp and RCGAToolbox_MissionControl_PE_R2021a.mlapp did not work on MATLAB R2016a (Windows).
